## Introduction
The average consumer may not realize that soy is found in almost everything they eat. From the vegetable oil in store-bought hummus, to the lecithin found in chocolate bars, to the mono- and diglycerides found in hot chocolate packets and on the outside of apples, soy is everywhere. Despite soy’s prominence in our food, most soy grown on earth is turned into animal feed; soy is by far the most common item on the menu for farmed animals, who eat over 90 percent of the soy grown today.1 In 2021, six percent of the earth’s surface was covered with soybeans.2

Throughout the past three decades, soybean growers in parts of South America have developed a reputation as the villains behind a rapid acceleration in Amazonian deforestation.3 However, the story is not so simple; soy is a highly politicized crop, entrenched in questions of land ownership, supply chains, and value. How did soybeans go from being pesky weeds – which were so resilient that people just had to find a use for them – to a crop with demand so high that it is replacing trees in the Amazon? The history of soy provides a glimpse into the inextricable nature of plants, capitalism, and human life. Within the context of a changing climate, questions regarding the sustainability of our food system are more pertinent than ever. The changing role of soybeans could provide a cautionary tale.

## Humble Origins
Wild soybeans, glycine soja, were originally found in a range which “extends from Afghanistan in the west to Japan in the east, and from southern Siberia in the north to the subtropics of the Yangzi River valley.”4 Glycine soja is thought to have been “naturally distributed…as early as 9,000 years ago.”5 Initially, soy, like wheat at the time, was not seen as a prized food for human consumption due to its difficulty to consume without proper preparation.

Soy’s reputation began to change in the 3rd century BCE when a fermented soy product known as shi became popular in China.7 Soy was also mentioned in the Fan Shengzhi shu, a Han Dynstasy agricultural text from 1st century BCE.8 Shengzhi wrote detailed instructions for how to plant and cultivate soybeans and even predicted what yields would be. Even then, most soybeans were used as animal feed.9 Soybeans were also mentioned in Li Shizen’s medical manual Bencao gangmu, where he described that “virtually every part of the plant was used as medicine.”10 The European word for soy, “soya” comes from the Japanese word shoyu, or soy sauce; “the bean was named, in other words, for its processed product.”11 Centuries later, the soybean was taxonomized by Carl Linnaeus as ‘glycine,’ meaning sweet, and ‘max’ due to its large nitrogen-fixing nodules.12

## Introduction
[*Ilex paraguariensis*](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:315555-2) is an [evergreen](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evergreen) shrub or tree native to the subtropical forests of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina that can grow up to forty-nine feet tall. The largest mate plantations are near Natal. It’s a plant species of the genus ilex (or “holly”) that contains caffeine as well as other alkaloid components, and it has stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties that made it attractive to both the indigenous Guaraní people and to Spanish colonial settlers. After being dried, roasted, and powdered, mate leaves are used to prepare a hot or cold beverage, also known as mate or Paraguayan Tea. The loose powder is typically steeped in hot water and strained through a <span data-click-image-zoomto="344,370,219,184">metallic straw, or bombilla</span>, shared by many people, passing from mouth to mouth. During the 19th century, the drink became associated with South American gauchos. The same mate and bombilla are shared in social gatherings, a habit that has endured despite recent public health campaigns to prevent COVID-19 pandemic.
