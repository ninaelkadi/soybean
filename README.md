## Introduction
The average consumer may not realize that soy is found in almost everything they eat. From the vegetable oil in store-bought hummus, to the lecithin found in chocolate bars, to the mono- and diglycerides found in hot chocolate packets and on the outside of apples, soy is everywhere. Despite soy’s prominence in our food, most soy grown on earth is turned into animal feed; soy is by far the most common item on the menu for farmed animals, who eat over 90 percent of the soy grown today.1 In 2021, six percent of the earth’s surface was covered with soybeans.2

Throughout the past three decades, soybean growers in parts of South America have developed a reputation as the villains behind a rapid acceleration in Amazonian deforestation.3 However, the story is not so simple; soy is a highly politicized crop, entrenched in questions of land ownership, supply chains, and value. How did soybeans go from being pesky weeds – which were so resilient that people just had to find a use for them – to a crop with demand so high that it is replacing trees in the Amazon? The history of soy provides a glimpse into the inextricable nature of plants, capitalism, and human life. Within the context of a changing climate, questions regarding the sustainability of our food system are more pertinent than ever. The changing role of soybeans could provide a cautionary tale.

## Humble Origins
Wild soybeans, glycine soja, were originally found in a range which “extends from Afghanistan in the west to Japan in the east, and from southern Siberia in the north to the subtropics of the Yangzi River valley.”4 Glycine soja is thought to have been “naturally distributed…as early as 9,000 years ago.”5 Initially, soy, like wheat at the time, was not seen as a prized food for human consumption due to its difficulty to consume without proper preparation.

Soy’s reputation began to change in the 3rd century BCE when a fermented soy product known as shi became popular in China.7 Soy was also mentioned in the Fan Shengzhi shu, a Han Dynstasy agricultural text from 1st century BCE.8 Shengzhi wrote detailed instructions for how to plant and cultivate soybeans and even predicted what yields would be. Even then, most soybeans were used as animal feed.9 Soybeans were also mentioned in Li Shizen’s medical manual Bencao gangmu, where he described that “virtually every part of the plant was used as medicine.”10 The European word for soy, “soya” comes from the Japanese word shoyu, or soy sauce; “the bean was named, in other words, for its processed product.”11 Centuries later, the soybean was taxonomized by Carl Linnaeus as ‘glycine,’ meaning sweet, and ‘max’ due to its large nitrogen-fixing nodules.12

Soybeans have an innate ability to grow almost anywhere and survive almost anything. Their resiliency has lent them to be referred to as “weedy.” 13 In the beginning of the soybean story, people did not really choose the soybean – the soybean, an ideal crop with its spread-ability and resilience, chose people. 14 Samira Peruchi Moretto et. al noted, “Soybeans probably began their career in agriculture not as valued crops, but as weeds that could be eaten if necessary.”15

## International Expansion
Soy sauce is mentioned in British texts as early as the 17th century, but the 18th century is when soy production really took off worldwide.16 In the 18th century, people began exporting soybeans from then-Manchuria, a fertile region of Northeast China, to other areas “like Shanghai and Amoy, where the beans were processed into condiments or pressed for oil.”17 As Brian Lander and Thomas David DuBois explained, the “explosion of global interest in soybeans coincided with a race to develop Manchuria itself.”18

The beans are thought to have first made landfall in the United States as early as the 18th century when Samuel Bowen, an Englishman who travelled to China with the British East India Company, brought soybean seeds to the U.S. He asked the surveyor general of Georgia to plant the seeds for him, and included detailed notes about what the plant could be used for, primarily noting that the soybeans could be used to produce soy sauce for export to England.19 In his note, Bowen also described how people in China turned the soybeans into Vermicelli, a type of noodle. The surveyor general confirmed that the soybean did yield three crops and may have even yielded a fourth had he tended to the crop.20

While the soybean was initially brought to the U.S. to produce and export soy sauce to Europe, by the early 20th century, American scientists and governmental agencies were also searching for alternative uses for the bean. In his 1918 Farmers’ Bulletin, USDA Scientific Assistant William Morse published a list of potential uses for soybean. Some options included ‘infant foods,’ ‘diabetic foods,’ ‘explosives,’ and ‘varnish.’21

Months after the United States entered World War I, the soybean was developing a reputation for being a protein-packed crop which could save the U.S. from food shortages. One author in a 1917 article in the Missouri-based Chicago Packer farming magazine wrote of soybeans: “In China the soy bean replaces in turn meat, milk, flour, eggs for the human population and fodder and silage for the animals…In the United States it can do the same…”22 

To this author, soybeans were seen as a potential alternative to the fruits of other industries, like the dairy industry, which rely more heavily on the unpredictability of human labor. 

“The soy bean does not keep union hours. It does not hesitate to supplant any and all foods. It has no respect for the division of labor and for specialization of industry, It is prepared to break strikes. Why should any one worry about a milk strike when the soy bean can become at a moment’s notice, a very acceptable cow?”
